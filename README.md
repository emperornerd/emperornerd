I'm available for hire! If you've seen my code, you know I'm no developer; I'm a Systems Administrator and security guru. Willing to entertain odd jobs or full or part time. If you're in Colorado Springs I'm also down to run cable, build custom computers, or whatever you need. If it has a power plug, I'm your guy!
Willing to work for a discount if your company or charity is trying to save the world. 

I'm also a pretty good yo-yo player, eBay seller, a 3D printer operator, mineral oil computer aficionado, builder of singing floppies (I use Moppy: https://github.com/Sammy1Am/Moppy2) and a licensed HAM radio user. I love DefCon.
